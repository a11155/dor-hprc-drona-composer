# Introduction to Drona

**Drona** is an HPC workflow assistant that eliminates the steep learning curve for running scientific workflows on high-performance computing resources. It abstracts HPC complexities while maintaining full researcher control over their computational workflows.

## What is Drona?

Drona addresses a critical challenge: HPC resources are increasingly complex while becoming more popular among novice researchers who lack traditional HPC skills. This creates inefficiencies and places burden on both researchers and HPC support teams.

Drona provides a user-friendly GUI that guides researchers through configuring their scientific workflows. It generates all necessary scripts, displays them in an editable preview window for transparency and control, then submits jobs on the researcher's behalf.

## Core Capabilities

**Workflow Assistant**: Intuitive interface guides researchers through scientific workflow configuration without requiring deep HPC knowledge.

**Full Transparency**: All generated scripts are displayed in an editable preview window, ensuring complete visibility and control over the computational process.

**Extensible Framework**: Researchers and administrators can create, customize, and share new workflows using Drona's declarative framework.

**Advanced Feedback**: Dynamic validation and feedback help researchers provide correct and meaningful workflow configuration.
