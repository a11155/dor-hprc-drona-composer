# Using Drona Workflow Engine

Drona Workflow Engine (or just Drona) provides a 100% graphical interface to create and run any workflow without the need to write a Slurm script or even be aware of Slurm syntax. It guides you to provide the relevant information to generate and submit a job for many different workflows and environments.

## Accessing Drona Workflow Engine

Drona is available on all HPRC Portals. Once you log in to your favorite portal, go to the **Jobs** tab and select **Drona Workflow Engine**. This will open a new window showing the Drona Workflow Engine interface.

## Drona Environments

Drona provides a number of environments to choose from. To select an environment, use the **Environments Dropdown**.

Drona Workflow Engine checks for environments in the following two locations:

1. **Drona system directory** - System-wide environments maintained by HPRC
2. **`$SCRATCH/drona_composer/environments`** - Your personal environments

System environments appear in **black** and environments in your SCRATCH directory appear in **blue**. HPRC provides environments for numerous research areas. Later, we will show how to [import additional environments](#importing-drona-environments) to your SCRATCH directory.

## Drona Input Form

Once you select an environment, additional fields relevant to the selected environment will become visible. The following screenshot shows the **Generic** environment, which is the most flexible and allows you to create any job script.

Some of the form's fields include:

- **Module element** - Easily add all the modules needed in your job script
- **File upload field** - Upload data and scripts
- **Accelerator field** - Specify what kind of accelerator (if any) you want to use
- **Resource fields** - Specify common job requirements and advanced batch scheduler-specific options

For other environments, these fields will be very different and specific to that particular environment.

:::tip
To get additional information for any of the input fields, hover over the little question mark icon. It will show additional information and help.

:::note
You are not required to enter values for all (or any) of the fields. When no value is specified, Drona Workflow Engine will use default values. Once you are finished entering values, click the **Preview** button.

## Drona Preview Window

After clicking Preview, a preview window will appear showing the generated job scripts and any validation messages.

The preview window contains the following components:

### Message Pane

Drona analyzes the provided input values to make sure there are no mistakes or inconsistencies. The message pane can also show environment-specific messages to assist you.

For example, a warning might indicate that a GPU was requested for 4 days, but the maximum wall time to request a GPU on ACES is two days.

### Generated Script Tabs

Drona generates job scripts based on your input. It will insert code for requested modules and changes to the correct directory. For most environments, it will also set up and execute that environment.

All the job script windows are **fully editable**. For the Generic profile, this is the place where you enter the commands you want to execute in the job.

## Importing Drona Environments

HPRC provides environments from a variety of research areas. These environments are available in a repository where you can import from.

Next to the Environments dropdown, you will find a **+** button. Clicking this button will open a new window with available environments you can import.

To import an environment, simply click the **Add** button and Drona will copy the environment to `$SCRATCH/drona_composer/environments`.
