  abstract  = {HPC resources are becoming increasingly complex, while HPC itself is becoming more popular among novice researchers across a wide range of research domains. These novice researchers often lack typical HPC skills, which results in a steep learning curve that leads to frustration and inefficient use of HPC resources. To address this, we developed Drona Workflow Engine. Drona offers an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that assists researchers in running their scientific workflows. The researcher provides the required information for their specific scientific workflow, and Drona generates all the scripts needed to run that workflow on the researcher's behalf. For transparency and additional flexibility, Drona will display all generated scripts in a fully editable preview window, allowing the researcher to make any final adjustments as needed. Drona also provides a flexible framework for importing, creating, adapting, and sharing custom scientific workflows. Drona significantly enhances researcher productivity by abstracting the underlying HPC complexities while retaining full control over their workflows.},
